Pong README

To load the game onto the UC Fun Kit 4:
    1. Using a terminal, go into the directory holding all the game modules and the Makefile
    2. Enter 'make program' into the terminal for each of the to boards


Starting the Game:
    After the game is loaded onto each board, they should both be displaying "READY UP".
    
    1. Make sure both players have loaded the game before continuing.
    2. Press the navswitch down. If you pushed ready up before your opponent,
       you will have to wait for them before the game starts.
    
    NOTE: Please ensure that both players do not ready up at the same time, half a second will be plenty of time to wait.

Playing the Game:
    Once both players have readied up, the game will begin to count down from 3.
    The board will then display "GO", at which point each player will have control of the paddles.
    
    You can move the paddle by pushing the navswitch left or right (using the same orientation as the displayed text).
    The ball will gradually increase in speed as the round progresses.
    
    As soon as a player misses the ball with their paddle, the round is over and the current score is displayed.
    A new round will begin after another countdown.

    The first player to 3 wins!

Starting a New Game:
    After the game finishes, your screen will display either "LOSER" or "WINNER".
    If you wish to start a new game, push the navswitch in to go back to the "READY UP" screen.
    Again, make sure both players are on this screen before continuing.
    From here, the process is the same as earlier in the 'Starting the Game' section (Step 2).
